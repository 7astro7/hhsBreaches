## Description

The Office for Civil Rights portal maintains an archive of data 
describing medical data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals 
stretching back to 2009

The hhs bot in data_collection saves the labor involved in opening up a web browser, 
avoiding distraction, finding the exact page that has HHS' archived breach report,
making sure the number of rows matches cases under investigation + solved cases, etc.

Revisions and suggestions are appreciated!
