The PHI included names, addresses, dates of birth, and insurance information.  During the investigation, OCR determined that the disclosure to the BA for payment purposes was permissible, as the email reached the intended BA, and there was no evidence that PHI was impermissibly disclosed to any other party.

The breach affected patients\u2019 names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, medical insurance information and\/or blood test results. The CE reported the incident to local law enforcement.  In response to OCR\u2019s contact in this matter, the CE ensured the proper breach notifications were provided, took steps to prevent the risk of future physical theft incidents at its office (such as by adding locks, cameras, and alarms), increased its technical controls of ePHI (such as utilizing encrypted software and conducting risk assessments), adopted HIPAA policies and procedures, and engaged in HIPAA training.

The ePHI involved included names, social security numbers, medical identification numbers, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, and employment information.

Go365 is a reward and incentive program that helps participants track and reach health goals.  Humana determined that 863 individuals were affected, 357 of whom are Humana insurance members. The other 486 affected individuals are employees of self-insured entities that contract with Humana to administer their insurance programs. Humana formally notified all these entities of the breach (a total of 179 employers).  The types of protected health information involved in the breach included participants' names, addresses, email addresses, identification numbers, biometric screening information, and other wellness information. Following the breach, Humana deployed two updates to the Go365 application and fixed the programming error and initiated ongoing monitoring to ensure the fix was effective.

UMMC will pay a resolution amount of $2,750,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to help assure future compliance with HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. \r\n\r\n\u201cIn addition to identifying risks and vulnerabilities to their ePHI, entities must also implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to address them within an appropriate time frame,\u201d said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  \u201cWe at OCR remain particularly concerned with unaddressed risks that may lead to impermissible access to ePHI.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 2013, OCR was notified of a breach after UMMC\u2019s privacy officer discovered that a password-protected laptop was missing from UMMC\u2019s Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).  UMMC's investigation concluded that it had likely been stolen by a visitor to the MICU who had inquired about borrowing one of the laptops.  OCR\u2019s investigation revealed that ePHI stored on a UMMC network drive was vulnerable to unauthorized access via UMMC\u2019s wireless network because users could access an active directory containing 67,000 files after entering a generic username and password.  The directory included 328 files containing the ePHI of an estimated 10,000 patients dating back to 2008.\r\n\r\nFurther, OCR\u2019s investigation revealed that UMMC failed to:  \r\n\u2022implement its policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations;\r\n\u2022implement physical safeguards for all workstations that access ePHI to restrict access to authorized users;\r\n\u2022assign a unique user name and\/or number for identifying and tracking user identity in information systems containing ePHI; and\r\n\u2022notify each individual whose unsecured ePHI was reasonably believed to have been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed as a result of the breach.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Mississippi is the state\u2019s sole public academic health science center with education and research functions.

These functions include, but are not limited to, finance, human resources, information services and technical support, insurance, compliance and administrative functions. \n\nOn November 5, 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) received notification from Woman & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island (WIH), a covered entity member of CNE, of the loss of unencrypted backup tapes containing the ultrasound studies of approximately 14,000 individuals, including patient name, data of birth, date of exam, physician names, and, in some instances Social Security Numbers.  As WIH\u2019s business associate, CNE provides centralized corporate support including technical support and information security for WIH\u2019s information systems.  WIH provided OCR with a business associate agreement with Care New England Health System effective March 15, 2005, that was not updated until August 28, 2015, as a result of OCR\u2019s investigation, and therefore, did not incorporate revisions required under the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule.\n\nOCR\u2019s investigation found the following:\n\u2022\tFrom September 23, 2014 until August 28, 2015, WIH disclosed protected health information (PHI) and allowed its business associate, CNE, to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on its behalf, without obtaining satisfactory assurances as required under HIPAA.  WIH failed to renew or modify its existing written business associate agreement with CNE to include the applicable implementation specifications required by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. \n\u2022\tFrom September 23, 2014, until August 28, 2015, WIH impermissibly disclosed the PHI of at least 14,004 individuals to its business associate when WIH provided CNE with access to PHI without obtaining satisfactory assurances, in the form of a written business associate agreement, that CNE would appropriately safeguard the PHI.\n\n\u201cThis case illustrates the vital importance of reviewing and updating, as necessary, business associate agreements, especially in light of required revisions under the Omnibus Final Rule, said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. \u201cThe Omnibus Final Rule outlined necessary changes to established business associate agreements and new requirements which include provisions for reporting.  A sample Business Associate Agreement can be found on OCR\u2019s website to assist covered entities in complying with this requirement.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the underlying breach, on July 17, 2014, WIH entered into a consent judgment with the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office (AGO), and reached a settlement of $150,000.  OCR found the consent judgment to sufficiently cover most of the conduct in this breach, including the failure to implement appropriate safeguards related to the handling of the PHI contained on the backup tapes and the failure to provide timely notification to the affected individuals. While the AGO\u2019s actions do not legally preclude OCR from imposing civil money penalties, OCR determined not to include additional potential violations in this case for the purposes of settlement, given that such potential violations had already been addressed by the AGO and based on OCR\u2019s policy approach to concurrent cases with State AGOs.

URMC includes healthcare components such as the School of Medicine and Dentistry and Strong Memorial Hospital. URMC is one of the largest health systems in New York State with over 26,000 employees.\n\nURMC filed breach reports with OCR in 2013 and 2017 following its discovery that protected health information (PHI) had been impermissibly disclosed through the loss of an unencrypted flash drive and theft of an unencrypted laptop, respectively. OCR's investigation revealed that URMC failed to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis; implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; utilize device and media controls; and employ a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information (ePHI) when it was reasonable and appropriate to do so. Of note, in 2010, OCR investigated URMC concerning a similar breach involving a lost unencrypted flash drive and provided technical assistance to URMC. Despite the previous OCR investigation, and URMC's own identification of a lack of encryption as a high risk to ePHI, URMC permitted the continued use of unencrypted mobile devices.\n\n\"Because theft and loss are constant threats, failing to encrypt mobile devices needlessly puts patient health information at risk,\" said Roger Severino, OCR Director. \"When covered entities are warned of their deficiencies, but fail to fix the problem, they will be held fully responsible for their neglect.\"\n\nIn addition to the monetary settlement, URMC will undertake a corrective action plan that includes two years of monitoring their compliance with the HIPAA Rules.

Cancer Care paid $750,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program. Cancer Care Group is a radiation oncology private physician practice, with 13 radiation oncologists serving hospitals and clinics throughout Indiana.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 2012, OCR received notification from Cancer Care regarding a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) after a laptop bag was stolen from an employee\u2019s car. The bag contained the employee\u2019s computer and unencrypted backup media, which contained the names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance information and clinical information of approximately 55,000 current and former Cancer Care patients.\r\n\r\nOCR\u2019s subsequent investigation found that, prior to the breach, Cancer Care was in widespread non-compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule.

Further, Cancer Care did not have in place a written policy specific to the removal of hardware and electronic media containing ePHI into and out of its facilities, even though this was common practice within the organization. OCR found that these two issues, in particular, contributed to the breach, as an enterprise-wide risk analysis could have identified the removal of unencrypted backup media as an area of significant risk to Cancer Care\u2019s ePHI, and a comprehensive device and media control policy could have provided employees with direction in regard to their responsibilities when removing devices containing ePHI from the facility.\r\n\r\n\u201cOrganizations must complete a comprehensive risk analysis and establish strong policies and procedures to protect patients\u2019 health information,\u201d said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. \u201cFurther, proper encryption of mobile devices and electronic media reduces the likelihood of a breach of protected health information.\u201d\r\n\r\nCancer Care has taken corrective action with regard to the specific requirements of the Privacy and Security Rules that are at the core of this enforcement action, as well as actions to come into compliance with the other provisions of the HIPAA Rules.
